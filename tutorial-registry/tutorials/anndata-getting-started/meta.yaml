name: Getting started with AnnData
description: |
    Suppose a colleague of yours did some single cell data analysis in Python and Scanpy,
    saving the results in an AnnData object and sending it to you in a *.h5ad file. This tutorial will walk you
    through that file and help you explore its structure and content â€” even if you are new to anndata, Scanpy or Python.
