# scverse-tutorials

If you are new to the scverse, get started with this set of tutorials covering

-   scverse datastructures
-   basic single-cell analyses
-   modality-specific analyses

using both core and ecosystem scverse packages.

For more tutorials as well as API documentation and user guides, see the sites of
[individual packages](https://scverse.org/packages/). You can also find recordings of past talks and workshops on
our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpsvsIAW3R5OdftJKKuLNMA).

AnnData and MuData are datastructures to hold unimodal and
multimodal single-cell data, respectively. All scverse packages
are based on these datastructures. This tutorial will get you up to speed
with our datastructures, even if you are new to Python.
